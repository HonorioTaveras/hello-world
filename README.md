# hello-world
First repository creation!

My name is Honorio Taveras. Some call me Kokopelli. Others know me by my blood-family name, Titi. I prefer you call me Honorio. I rock climb, I code, I create music, I live in a school bus, I'm in an awesome relationship, I create community dynamics for a better future and to usher in the new paradigm I like to call New Earth or Civilization Next. I've got lofty ideals, and I will do my best to manifest them. I like to believe I adapt to anything in life with an open mind and not get stuck in my beliefs or dogma. Try me. I have ambitions to create my own company. More on that later though, for now I believe this is an ample summary/introduction. Thanks for making time to read. dirtbagClimberTechBro out.
